## Jupyter Notebook Settings 

The basic Jupyter Notebook is neither efficient nor easy on the eyes. Below are what I do to improve both. 

### Jupyter Themes 
My favorite Jupyter Notebook theme is from [jupyterthemes](https://github.com/dunovank/jupyter-themes):

Step 1: install jupyterthemes 

``pip install jupyterthemes``

Step 2: select the theme and various fonts for codes, texts, and notebooks. 

``jt -t monokai -f ubuntu -nf ptsans -tf exosans -T -N``

### Jupyter Notebook Extensions 

Since the notebooks are relatively long, I strongly recommend installing [jupyter_contrib_nbextensions](https://jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) 
and enabling the following nbextensions:

- Table of Contents (2)
- Collapsible Headings
- Equation Auto Numbering 
- Codefolding
